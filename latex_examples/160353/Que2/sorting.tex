\section{Introduction}
Sorting is one of the most fundamental operations in computer science useful in numerous applications. Given a sequence of numbers as input, the output should provide a non-decreasing sequence of numbers as output. More formally, we define a sorting problem as follows [1], \newline
\textbf{Input:} A sequence of n numbers $\langle a\textsubscript{1}, a\textsubscript{2}, .... , a\textsubscript{n}\rangle.$\\
\textbf{Output:} A reordered sequence (of size n) $\langle a'_1, a'_2, .... , a'_n \rangle$
of the input sequence such that $a'_1 \leq a'_2 \leq ... \leq a'_n.$
\newline
Consider the following example. Given an input
sequence $\langle8, 34, 7, 9, 15, 91, 15\rangle$, a sorting algorithm
should return $\langle7, 8, 9, 15, 15, 34, 91\rangle$ as output.
\par
A fundamental problem like sorting has attracted many researchers who contributed with innovative
algorithms to solve the problem of sorting efficiently [3]. Efficiency of an algorithm depends on
primarily on two aspects,
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Time complexity} is a formalism that captures running time of an algorithm in terms of the size input size. Normally, \textit{asymptotic} behaviour on the input size is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms.
    \item \textbf{Space complexity} is a formalism that captures amount of memory of memory used by an algorithm
in terms of input size. Like time complexity
analysis, asymptotic analysis is used for space
complexity.
\end{itemize}

In the branch of algorithms and complexity in computer science, space complexity takes a back seat compared to time complexity. Recently, another parameter of computing i.e., energy consumption has become popular. Roy et al. [4] proposed an energy complexity model for algorithms. In this document, we will deal with time complexity of sorting
algorithms. \par
One class of algorithms which are based on \textit{element comparison are commonly known as comparison based sorting algorithms.} In this document we will provide a brief overview of \texttt{Quicksort}, a commonly used comparison based sorting algorithm [2]. Quicksort
is a sorting algorithm based on \textit{divide-and -conquer} paradigm of algorithm design. Further, we
will
derive the lower bound of any comparison we
will
derive the lower bound of any $\Omega$ (n $log_2{n}$) for an input size of n.\par

\section{Quicksort}

Quicksort is designed as a three-step divide-and-
conquer process for sorting an input sequence in
an array [1]. For any given subarray, A[i..j], the
process is as follows,\\
\textbf{Divide:} The array A[i..j] is partitioned into two
subarrays A[i..k] and A[k + 1..j] such that all elements in A[i..k] is less than or equal to all elements in A[k + 1..j]. A partitioning procedure is called to determine k such that at the end of partitioning, the element at the $k^{th}$ position (i.e. A[\textit{k}) does not change its position in the final output array.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{Partition procedure of \texttt{Quicksort} algorithm.}
  \label{algo:ins_sort1}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Procedure{Parition}{\textit{A,i,j}}\newline
     \Comment{A is an array of \textit{N} integers, A[1..\textit{N}]}\newline
     \Comment{i and j are the start and end of subarray}
      \State $x \leftarrow$ A[i]
      \State $y \leftarrow$ i-1
      \State $z \leftarrow$ j+1
      \While {(true)}
        \State $z \leftarrow z-1$ 
        \While {$A[z] > x$}
          \State $z \leftarrow z -1$ 
        \EndWhile
        \State $y \leftarrow y + 1$
        \While{$A[y] < x$}
          \State $y \leftarrow y + 1$
        \EndWhile
      \If{$y < z$}
        \State Swap $A[y] \leftrightarrow A[z]$
      \Else
        \State return z
      \EndIf
      \EndWhile
     \EndProcedure 
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\textbf{Conquer:}Recursively invoke \texttt{Quicksort} on the two subarrays. This procedure conquers the complexity by applying the same operation in two sub arrays.\newline
\textbf{Merge:} Quicksort does not require merge or combine operation as the entire array A[i..j] is sorted in place.\par
In the heart of \texttt{Quicksort}, there is a partition procedure as shown in Algorithm 1. A pivot element x is selected. The first inner while loop (line \#6) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is smaller than or equal to the pivot element. Similarly, the second inner while loop (line
\#9) continues examining elements until it finds an element that is greater than or equal to the pivot element. If indices y and z have not exchanged their side around the pivot, the elements at A[y] and A[z] are exchanged. Otherwise, the procedure returns the index z, such that all elements to the left of z are smaller than or equal to A[z] and all
elements to the right of z are greater than or equal to A[z].\par
The main recursive procedure for \texttt{Quicksort} is presented in Algorithm 2. Initial invocation is performed by call QUICKSORT(A, 1, N ) where N is
the length of array N.

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{\texttt{Quicksort} recursion.}
  \label{algo:ins_sort1}
  \begin{algorithmic}[1]
     \Procedure{Quickshort}{\textit{A,i,j}}\newline
     \Comment{Quickshort procedure called with A, 1, \textit{N}}
      \If{$i < j$}
        \State $k \leftarrow $ \textsc{Partition}(A,i,j)
        \State \Call {Quickshort}{A, i, k} 
        \State \Call {Quickshort}{A, i, k}
      \EndIf
     \EndProcedure 
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}


\subsection{Time complexity analysis of \texttt{Quicksort}}
The worst case of \texttt{Quicksort} occurs when an array of length N , gets partitioned into two subarrays
of size N-1 and 1 in every recursive invocation of
QUICKSORT procedure in Algorithm 2. The partitioning procedure presented in Algorithm 1, takes $\Theta(n)$ time, the recurrence relation for running time
is,

\begin{equation*}
T(n) = T(n-1) + \Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
As it is evident that T (1) = $\Theta$(1), the recurrence is solved as follows.
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
T(n) &= T(n-1) + \Theta(n)\\
  &=\sum_{k=1}^n \Theta(k)\\
  &=\Theta\bigg(\sum_{k=1}^n k\bigg)\\
  &=\Theta(n^2)\\
\end{split}\end{equation*}
\par
Therefore, if the partitioning is always maximally unbalanced, the running time is $\Theta(n^2)$. Intutively, if an input sequence is almost sorted, \texttt{Quicksort} will perform poorly. In the best case, partitioning divides the array into two equal parts. Thus, the recurrence for the best case is given by,\par
\begin{equation*}
T(n) = 2T\bigg(\frac{n}{2}\bigg) + \Theta(n)
\end{equation*}
which evaluates to $\Theta(n log_2{n})$. Using a comparatively involved analysis, the average running time of \texttt{Quicksort} can be determined to be O(\textit{n} lg \textit{n}).

\section{Lower bounds on comparison sorts}
An interesting question about sorting algorithms
based on comparisons is the following: What is
the lower bound of this class of sorting algorithms? This question is important for algorithm
researchers to further improve the sorting algorithms.\par
A decision tree based analysis leads to the following theorem [1].\\\\
\textbf{Theorem 1.} \textit{Anye decision tree that sorts n elements has height $\Omega(n log_2{n}).$}\\\\\
\textit{Proof.} Consider a decision tree of height h that sorts n elements. Since there are n! permutations of n elements, each permutation representing a distinct sorted order, the tree must have at least n! leaves. Since a binary tree of height h has no more than $2^h$ leaves. So,\newline \vspace{2mm}
\hspace{3mm}$n! \leq 2^h$\newline \vspace{2mm}
Applying logarithmic $(log_2)$, the equality becomes,\newline \vspace{2mm}
$h \geq lg(n!)$\newline \vspace{2mm}
Applying Stirling's approximations,\newline \vspace{2mm}
$n! > \big( \frac{n}{e} \big)^n$\newline
where e is natural bse of algoriths, Further, 
\begin{equation*}\begin{split}
    h &\geq lg\bigg( \frac{n}{e} \bigg)^n\\
    &= nlgn - nlge\\
    &=\Omega(nlgn)\\
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
